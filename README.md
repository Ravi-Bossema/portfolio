# Hi, I'm Ravi, Software Developer

For as long as I can remember I've had a strong passion for making things. Whether it was building Legos, sculpting with clay, or drawing pictures, I loved it. And I still do, although now I pursue that creative passion in the field of Software Development.

In addition to making things, I also love playing all sorts of games; from sports- to tabletop games and everything in between. Considering these two interests it should come as no surprise that I aspire to enter the world of Game Development.

Now, with a Bachelor's Degree in Artificial Intelligence under my belt, I feel that it's about time to make that dream a reality.
